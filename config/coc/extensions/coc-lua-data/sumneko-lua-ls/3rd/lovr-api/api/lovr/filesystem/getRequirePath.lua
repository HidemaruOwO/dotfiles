    Returns the require path.  The require path is a semicolon-separated list of patterns that LÃ–VR
    will use to search for files when they are `require`d.  Any question marks in the pattern will
    be replaced with the module that is being required.  It is similar to Lua\'s `package.path`
    variable, but the main difference is that the patterns are relative to the virtual filesystem.
