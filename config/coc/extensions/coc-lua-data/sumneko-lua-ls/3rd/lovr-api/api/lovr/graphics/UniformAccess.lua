    When binding writable resources to shaders using `Shader:sendBlock` and `Shader:sendImage`, an
    access pattern can be specified as a hint that says whether you plan to read or write to the
    resource (or both).  Sometimes, LÃ–VR or the GPU driver can use this hint to get better
    performance or avoid stalling.
