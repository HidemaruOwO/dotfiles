---@meta

---
---Manages events, like keypresses.
---
---@class love.event
love.event = {}

---
---Clears the event queue.
---
function love.event.clear() end

---
---Returns an iterator for messages in the event queue.
---
---@return function i # Iterator function usable in a for loop.
function love.event.poll() end

---
---Pump events into the event queue.
---
---This is a low-level function, and is usually not called by the user, but by love.run.
---
---Note that this does need to be called for any OS to think you're still running,
---
---and if you want to handle OS-generated events at all (think callbacks).
---
function love.event.pump() end

---
---Adds an event to the event queue.
---
---From 0.10.0 onwards, you may pass an arbitrary amount of arguments with this function, though the default callbacks don't ever use more than six.
---
---@param n love.Event # The name of the event.
---@param a? any # First event argument.
---@param b? any # Second event argument.
---@param c? any # Third event argument.
---@param d? any # Fourth event argument.
---@param e? any # Fifth event argument.
---@param f? any # Sixth event argument.
function love.event.push(n, a, b, c, d, e, f) end

---
---Adds the quit event to the queue.
---
---The quit event is a signal for the event handler to close LÃ–VE. It's possible to abort the exit process with the love.quit callback.
---
---@overload fun(restart: string|"'restart'")
---@param exitstatus? number # The program exit status to use when closing the application.
function love.event.quit(exitstatus) end

---
---Like love.event.poll(), but blocks until there is an event in the queue.
---
---@return love.Event n # The name of event.
---@return any a # First event argument.
---@return any b # Second event argument.
---@return any c # Third event argument.
---@return any d # Fourth event argument.
---@return any e # Fifth event argument.
---@return any f # Sixth event argument.
function love.event.wait() end

---
---Arguments to love.event.push() and the like.
---
---Since 0.8.0, event names are no longer abbreviated.
